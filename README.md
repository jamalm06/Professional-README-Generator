# Professional README Generator

## Description
The Professional README Generator is a command-line tool built with Node.js and the Inquirer package. It streamlines the process of creating a professional README.md file for your projects. By prompting you with a series of questions, it collects the necessary information and generates a README.md file with sections for description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, licenses, and tests.
